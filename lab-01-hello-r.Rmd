### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```


### Lab Exercise
answer for task 3

``` (Add code and narrative as needed. Note that the R chunks are labeled with 'plot-star' and 'cor-star' to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean up the narrative by removing these instructions.)

``
answer for task 4
```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  filter(dataset == "circle")
ggplot (data = circle_data, mapping = aes (x = x, y = y)) + geom_point () (Correlation Coefficient = -0.0645 ) in dino 
( the graph like dinosaur)
(correlaion coefficien -0.0683 ) in circle
the graph like circle )
```
